# Multi-Flavor Push Notifications

This is a sample Android application that demonstrates multi-flavor push notifications setup using Firebase and JPush. The application has two flavors - Firebase and JPush - to showcase the different push notification setups.

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Select the flavor you want to run (Firebase or JPush) from the Build Variants tab in the Android Studio toolbar
